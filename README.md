Papers about fairness in NLP/CV/ML

## Background
Fairness, accountability, transparity and ethics become more and more important in machine learning communities. We hope to provide a list of great papers that can work as a reference for researchers interested in such topics. This repo mainly focuses on NLP area but we also point to some resources in the end.
